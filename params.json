{"name":"clang-redist","body":"This project provides packaged binaries containing:\r\n\r\n - Clang and Clang libraries for OS X and Linux (x86 and x86-64 distributions)\r\n - GCC libraries (e.g. libstdc++) for Linux only\r\n\r\nThe packages provide a C++11 toolchain, and they provide the Clang libraries\r\nneeded for the SourceWeb indexer.\r\n\r\nBinaries from the current version 1 release were built on x86 and x86-64\r\nUbuntu 10.04 and OS X 10.8.  The Linux binaries should work on most currently\r\nsupported Linux distributions, which have libc and libstdc++ libraries no older\r\nthan those in Ubuntu 10.04. This includes:\r\n\r\n - Debian 6.0.\r\n - Ubuntu 10.04 and up.\r\n - Fedora 16 and up.\r\n - OpenSUSE 12.1 and up.\r\n - CentOS 6.x.\r\n\r\nThe packages will not work on CentOS 5.x, which uses libstdc++-4.2.\r\n\r\nOn OS X, the Clang libraries were built for libc++, not libstdc++.  They\r\nshould work on OS 10.8, might work on 10.7, but will not work with 10.6, which\r\ndoes not have libc++.\r\n\r\n## Download links\r\n\r\n| Package        | x86 Linux     | x86-64 Linux  | x86-64 OS X   |\r\n| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Clang 3.2      | [Download][1] | [Download][2] | [Download][3] |\r\n| gcc-libs 4.6.3 | [Download][4] | [Download][5] | n/a           |\r\n| gcc-libs 4.7.2 | [Download][6] | [Download][7] | n/a           |\r\n\r\n[1]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/clang-3.2-1-x86-linux.tar.bz2\r\n[2]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/clang-3.2-1-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2\r\n[3]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/clang-3.2-1-x86_64-darwin.tar.bz2\r\n[4]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/gcc-libs-4.6.3-1-x86-linux.tar.bz2\r\n[5]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/gcc-libs-4.6.3-1-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2\r\n[6]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/gcc-libs-4.7.2-1-x86-linux.tar.bz2\r\n[7]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/gcc-libs-4.7.2-1-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2\r\n\r\n[SHA256 checksums](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rprichard-released-software/clang-redist/release-1/sha256sums-installables.txt)\r\n\r\n## Linux usage note\r\n\r\nOn Linux, extract a clang package and a gcc-libs package into the same directory.\r\nPassing `--strip-components=1` to tar is helpful for doing this.  e.g.:\r\n\r\n    mkdir clang-3.2-gcc-libs-4.6.3-1\r\n    cd clang-3.2-gcc-libs-4.6.3-1\r\n    tar --strip-components=1 -xf ../clang-3.2-1-x86-linux.tar.bz2\r\n    tar --strip-components=1 -xf ../gcc-libs-4.6.3-1-x86-linux.tar.bz2\r\n\r\nNote that at run-time, the binaries produced by this package may need a\r\nlibstdc++ newer than the one on the host system.  Either use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`\r\nto point at the packaged libstdc++, or compile with `-Wl,-R<path>` to embed an\r\nRPATH into the binary.\r\n","google":"","tagline":"Packages containing Clang and libstdc++ binaries for Linux and OS X","note":"Don't delete this file!
